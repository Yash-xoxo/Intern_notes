Launch a CentOS container using Docker.

Execute basic Linux commands inside the container (touch, cat, etc.).

Create a file inside the container using CLI tools (e.g., vi, nano).

Write and run a simple Python script inside the container.

Install missing packages inside the container using yum install.

Re-enter containers using docker attach after starting them.

Practice forcefully removing all containers (with caution):

bash

docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)
🧠 Programming Task (Inside Docker Containers)
For All Students:
Practice Python programming inside the container.

Use Linux command-line editors (like vi) to write and run Python files.

🤖 Machine Learning Students’ Tasks
Launch Docker container (CentOS or any base image).

Install Python + ML libraries (like numpy, pandas, scikit-learn) using pip.

Write and run a Linear Regression model inside the container.

Generate predictions using that model.

🌐 Flask Developers’ Tasks

Install Flask via pip.

Create and launch a Flask API inside the container.

🔁 CI/CD Understanding Task (Preview Exercise)
After every test or app run, destroy the previous container.

Launch a new clean container, set it up, and retest the app.

Practice environment recreation—this is preparation for CI/CD pipelines.
