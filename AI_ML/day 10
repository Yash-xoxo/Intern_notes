AI/ML Day 10 – Part 1 Notes
🔢 1. Introduction to Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
Unlike Simple Linear Regression (with one input X), MLR uses multiple features: X1, X2, X3....

Real-world problems are rarely influenced by one factor alone.

Equation:

ini
Copy
Edit
Y = W1*X1 + W2*X2 + W3*X3 + ... + b
🧩 2. Feature Contribution in Prediction
Each input variable (feature) contributes differently to the prediction.

These variables are called independent variables.

Examples for predicting marks:

X1 = Hours studied

X2 = Time spent in cafeteria

X3 = Luck factor

X4 = Teacher quality

🏋️ 3. Weights Determine Impact
Each feature has a weight (W):

W1 = Impact of X1

W2 = Impact of X2

Some features may even have negative weights, e.g., more cafeteria time → fewer marks.

🎯 4. Use Case Example: Job Packages
Features affecting your job placement:

X1 = CGPA

X2 = Summer Internship project

X3 = Communication skills

X4 = GitHub/Portfolio

Experts determine which features matter and how much (weight).

📊 5. Multiple Features in Dataset
Collecting data with multiple inputs:

e.g., Experience, CGPA, Project quality, Interview score

All features collectively help predict the target (e.g., salary).

📐 6. Understanding Regression in the Real World
Whenever a prediction depends on more than one factor, it is a Multiple Linear Regression problem.

Common in healthcare, finance, HR, education.

🧪 7. Feature Engineering
The process of:

Identifying meaningful variables

Measuring their contribution

Removing weak/unrelated variables

Core skill for a data scientist.

📉 8. Dataset Quality Determines Model Success
70%+ of ML models fail due to poor feature selection or low-quality data.

Quantity and quality of features both matter.

Most overlooked step = feature engineering.

📊 9. Dataset Example – 50_Startups.csv
Real dataset with:

R&D Spend

Administration Spend

Marketing Spend

State

Profit (Target)

Goal: Predict Profit using the other columns.

🧮 10. Preprocessing Categorical Data
Machine Learning only understands numbers, not strings.

For example, the column State (New York, Florida...) must be converted:

New York = 1

California = 2

Florida = 3

This process is called label encoding or data preprocessing.

🧠 11. Model = Mathematical Function
A machine learning model is essentially a math function:

ini
Copy
Edit
Y = W1*X1 + W2*X2 + W3*X3 + b
ML adjusts W1, W2... to fit the data during training.

⚠️ 12. Common ML Mistake: Input Data with Strings
If Y or X contains strings (like "New York"), ML will throw an error.

All input must be converted to numeric format before training.

🛠️ 13. Data Preprocessing Steps
Load dataset using Pandas.

Identify numerical and categorical columns.

Convert categorical data to numbers.

Split into X (features) and y (target).

Train model using LinearRegression().

🧠 14. Importance of Correct Feature Weighting
If a feature like "luck" or "cafeteria hours" has negative correlation, its weight will be negative.

The model learns which features help or hurt predictions.

🤖 15. LLMs Also Use Multiple Weights
GPT-3/4 models use billions or trillions of parameters (weights).

Even in NLP, each word or token is mapped to a number during training.

📊 16. Human Decisions = Multi-Feature Regression
Just like models, our decisions also depend on:

Emotions

Environment

Experience

Intent

The brain does multi-variable regression intuitively.

🧾 17. Code Snippets (Setup and Data Analysis)
python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("50_Startups.csv")

# Check structure
df.info()
Note:

State = string → must encode

Other columns = float → usable

📥 18. Preparing X and y
python
Copy
Edit
# Assume "Profit" is the target
X = df[["R&D Spend", "Administration", "Marketing Spend"]]
y = df["Profit"]
Ensure X contains only numeric columns.

🧠 19. Final Concepts
Regression ≠ always predicting marks or salary.

Can be used for:

Profit

Customer churn

Disease progression

Focus is always on numerical prediction using multiple independent variables.



📌 1. ML Can’t Process Strings
Machine learning algorithms only accept numerical data.

Any string column (like city or branch) must be converted to numbers before model training.

Example:

New York = 0

California = 1

Florida = 2

📌 2. Encoding Categorical Features
If you directly assign numbers (e.g., NY = 1, FL = 2), the model may misinterpret it as higher/lower value.

Solution: Use One-Hot Encoding (OHE) – convert each category into its own column.

📌 3. Why Not Use Direct Numerical Labels?
Assigning New York = 1 and California = 2 falsely implies order or weight.

Example: Model might treat California as “better” just because 2 > 1.

That’s why we use dummy variables (OHE).

📌 4. One-Hot Encoding = Dummy Variables
For a column State, OHE converts:

State_NewYork, State_California, State_Florida → each is a binary column (0 or 1).

Called dummy variables because only one column is 1 for each record.

📌 5. Real Example: Branch and Package
Let’s say:

IT branch → package: ₹10L

Civil branch → package: ₹4L

But branch name itself has no logical weight.

The ML model may misread branch names as features, which leads to bad predictions.

📌 6. Key Concept: Names Are Not Features
Names like branch, city, etc., must not be given direct numeric weight.

Instead, treat them as flags (0/1) with dummy variables.

📌 7. Constructing Dummy Variables in Code
python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("50_Startups.csv")
dummy = pd.get_dummies(df["State"], drop_first=True)
drop_first=True removes one column to avoid dummy variable trap (multicollinearity).

📌 8. Drop Original Categorical Column
python
Copy
Edit
df.drop("State", axis=1, inplace=True)
df = pd.concat([df, dummy], axis=1)
Now df only contains numeric values, ready for model training.

📌 9. Importance of Removing Original String Columns
Keeping both original string column and dummy variables causes confusion.

Must drop the original string column to avoid data redundancy.

📌 10. Real Meaning of Dummy Weights
Each dummy variable (e.g., State_Florida) will have its own weight.

Higher weight → better impact on prediction (e.g., profit).

Allows you to compare:

“Is Florida better for business than California?”

📌 11. Adding Dummies to Features (X)
python
Copy
Edit
X = df.drop("Profit", axis=1)
Now X has all numeric, independent variables including dummies.

The model can now handle multivariate regression.

📌 12. Total Feature Columns
If original columns: R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, and State

After OHE:

Columns = R&D + Admin + Marketing + State_Florida + State_New York (total 5)

Each will have its own weight (W1 to W5)

📌 13. Weight Interpretation
If W1 (R&D) = 2.6 → 1₹ spent on R&D = ₹2.6 profit

If W2 (Admin) = -1.2 → higher admin spend → lower profit

Dummy weights help suggest:

"Which state gives better return?"

📌 14. Real-World Strategy from Model
If Florida weight = 10 and California = 3 → prefer Florida

Use model output to guide:

Business decisions

Hiring preferences

Branch choice for students

📌 15. Final Preprocessing Checklist
✅ Remove string columns (like “State”)

✅ Add dummy variables

✅ Ensure all features are numeric

✅ Final X is clean and ready for ML

📌 16. Final Feature Engineering Concept
More features ≠ better results. Only relevant features with logical meaning should be used.

Good features improve accuracy

Bad features confuse the model

📌 17. How to Drop a Column (Recap)
python
Copy
Edit
X.drop("State", axis=1, inplace=True)  # axis=1 = drop column
axis=0 = drop row

axis=1 = drop column

📌 18. Permanent vs Temporary Drop
Use inplace=True for permanent deletion.

Otherwise, changes are not saved in the original variable.
