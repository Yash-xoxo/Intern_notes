JavaScript Front-End Core Concepts (Lecture Summary)
🖥️ JavaScript in the Browser
To interact with a web browser, JavaScript is the primary language.

HTML structures the page, but real behavior is controlled using JavaScript.

JavaScript can create logic, handle events, and manipulate page content dynamically.

📄 Basic JavaScript Setup
HTML + <script> tag is used to embed JS.

Code execution begins as soon as the browser loads the HTML.

For controlled execution, code is wrapped in functions.

⚙️ Functions in JavaScript
A function is a block of code executed only when called.

Syntax:

js
Copy
Edit
function exampleFunction() {
  // code to run
}
Call a function by using its name followed by ().

👆 Event Handling
Browsers can detect user actions:

click, dblclick, mouseover, keypress, etc.

Event listeners bind these actions to functions.

Common attribute: onclick="functionName()"

🔘 Interactivity via HTML Elements
Elements like <button>, <div>, <p> can be made interactive.

Example:

html
Copy
Edit
<button onclick="sendMail()">Send Mail</button>
This triggers a function defined in JavaScript.

🔍 DOM Manipulation
JavaScript can access and modify HTML content.

Each element can be given a unique id:

html
Copy
Edit
<div id="d1">Original Text</div>
Access it using:

js
Copy
Edit
document.getElementById("d1").innerHTML = "New Text";
Use .innerHTML to get or set content.

🧪 Reading and Writing Text
Two ways to display or fetch text in HTML:

Directly in the body (e.g., <div> content)

Inside form elements (<input>, <textarea>)

Use .value for form fields, .innerHTML for other elements.

🚀 Tasks Given in Lecture (Suggested Practice)
Create a mail sending function triggered via a button.

Click a photo using the webcam and save it.

Send the clicked photo via email.

Record a short video and email it.

Send a WhatsApp message through UI interaction.

Display user GPS location on Google Maps.

Show route guidance using Google Maps.

List grocery stores within 5–100km on a map.

Retrieve latest Gmail mails and display them.

Post to Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter directly from the webpage.

🔗 DOM Addressing & Targeting
Every HTML element to be controlled should have a unique ID.

Use document.getElementById("id") to interact.

Store the reference in a variable to reuse:

js
Copy
Edit
let x = document.getElementById("d1");
alert(x.innerHTML);
🧠 Key JavaScript Terms
innerHTML: Used to read or write content of an HTML tag.

.value: Used for reading from input boxes.

document: A special JS object that gives access to the entire page structure.
